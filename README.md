# civilaircraft - Neo4j Use Cases

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of three comprehensive use cases developed using Neo4j, showcasing the power of graph databases in solving complex business problems:

1. **Knowledge Management System:** Efficiently captures, manages, and transfers knowledge within an organization.
2. **Obsolescence Management System:** Manages and mitigates obsolescence risks in products and components.
3. **Component Shortage Management System:** Tracks and mitigates risks associated with component shortages in products.

## Why Neo4j?

Neo4j is a leading graph database platform that excels at uncovering connections between data points, making it ideal for complex scenarios like knowledge management, obsolescence management, and component shortage management. It enables:

* Visualizing data relationships clearly.
* Performing complex queries efficiently using Cypher.
* Leveraging the Graph Data Science (GDS) library for advanced analytics.
* Finding hidden insights and patterns within the data.

## Use Case Summaries

### 1. Knowledge Management System

* Captures employee skills, project experience, and training history.
* Identifies knowledge gaps and recommends skill transfers.
* Uses advanced graph algorithms (PageRank, knowledge gap analysis).

### 2. Obsolescence Management System

* Tracks products, components, and their suppliers.
* Identifies at-risk or obsolete components.
* Predicts obsolescence using lifecycle stages and supplier reliability.

### 3. Component Shortage Management System

* Manages products, components, and suppliers.
* Detects critical shortages and forecasts risks.
* Recommends mitigation strategies (e.g., alternative suppliers).

## Neo4j Graph Model

Across all three use cases, Neo4jâ€™s graph model leverages the following:

* Nodes (e.g., Employee, Skill, Product, Component, Supplier).
* Relationships (e.g., HAS\_SKILL, WORKED\_ON, USES, SUPPLIED\_BY).
* Properties (e.g., skill levels, lifecycle stages, inventory levels).

## How to Use

* Each use case is accompanied by a dedicated README document with detailed instructions.
* The datasets for each use case must be loaded into Neo4j using the provided Cypher queries.
* Advanced queries leverage Graph Data Science (GDS) for deeper insights.

## Benefits of Using Neo4j

* Discover hidden insights through data relationships.
* Visualize complex networks and connections.
* Make data-driven decisions faster.
* Scale easily as your data grows.

## Support
